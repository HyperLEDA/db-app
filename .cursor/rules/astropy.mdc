# Astropy Package Guidelines

## Units Usage

When using astropy units, use runtime units determination instead of direct attribute access.

**Preferred:**

```python
from astropy import units as u

# Usage
u.Unit("kpc")
u.Unit("km/s")
u.Unit("arcsec")
```

**Avoid:**

```python
from astropy import units as u

# Usage
u.kpc
u.km / u.s
u.arcsec
```

This approach provides better runtime flexibility and avoids potential linter issues.
