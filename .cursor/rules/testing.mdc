# Testing Guide

The project provides several different commands depending on your needs:

## Quick Tests

For small features or changes that affect a single component, use:

```bash
make test
```

This command runs:

- Unit tests
- Style/lint checks

## Fixing Style/Lint Issues

When style/lint check failures are encountered, use:

```bash
make fix
```

This command automatically fixes most style and linting issues in the codebase.

You can run these commands freely whenever you need to test something.
