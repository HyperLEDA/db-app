# Testing Guide

The project provides two different test commands depending on your needs:

## Quick Tests
For small features or changes that affect a single component, use:
```bash
make test
```
This command runs:
- Unit tests
- Style/lint checks

## Full Test Suite
For larger features or changes that touch multiple components, use:
```bash
make test-all
```
This command runs the complete test suite including integration tests.

You can run these commands freely whenever you need to test something.
