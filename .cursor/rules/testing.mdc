# Testing Guide

The project provides several different commands depending on your needs. For small features or changes that affect a single component, use:

```bash
make test
```

This command runs unit tests and style/lint checks.

When style/lint check failures are encountered, always use:

```bash
make fix
```

You should only fix style/lint issues by yourself if this command shows an error.
