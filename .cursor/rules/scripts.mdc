# Scripts and Python Execution

This project uses `uv` for package management. `uv` manages virtual environments as well, meaning that simple running of `python` command will not work.

## Running Python Scripts

When running Python scripts or commands, always use `uv run` instead of raw `python` or `python3`:

```bash
# Correct - use uv run
uv run python script.py
uv run python -c "print('Hello World')"
uv run python -m pytest

# Incorrect - don't use raw python
python script.py
python3 script.py
```
